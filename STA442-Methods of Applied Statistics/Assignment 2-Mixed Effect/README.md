# STA442 Assignment 2

In this assignment I did the following:
* Fit a mixed effects model on a dataset of Math Scores using schools as a random effect.
* Analyzed the Treatment Episode Data Set, accessed the fllowing hypothesis:
  - chance of a young person completing their drug treatment depends on the substance the individual is addicted to, with  ‘hard’ drugs being more difficult to treat than alcohol or marijuana.
  - some American states have particularly effective treatment programs whereas other states have programs which are highly problematic with very low completion rates.

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to decide between using Fixed and Random effects in a given model.
* How to use random slope models.
* How to set priors and posteriers in a dataset.
* How to interpret the results from a mixed effect model.

## Software Used
* This project was done in R, the report was rendered into LaTeX using RMarkdown.
* I used the following R packages:
	- nlme to fit Mixed Effects Models.

## How to Use
* Read ```homework2.pdf``` for assignment questions.
* Knit ```STA442 HW2.Rmd``` to generate the report.
* ```STA442-HW2.pdf``` is the generated report in PDF form.
