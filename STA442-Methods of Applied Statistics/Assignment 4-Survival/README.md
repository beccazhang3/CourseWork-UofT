# STA442 Assignment 4

In this assignment I analyzed the 2014 American National Youth Tobacco Survey and did the following:
- Derived a model using Weibull distribution for survival anlysis.
- Selected the valur for posteriers and prior for state and school random effects.
- Plotted and interpreted the Cumulative Hazard Function.
Also:
- Analyzed data of the road traffic accidents in the UK from 1979 to 2015.
- Set case and control, and stratification, used a conditional logistic regression.

## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* How to decide between using Fixed and Random effects in a given model.
* How to use survival analysis and conditional logistic regression.
* How to interpret the results from Cumulative Hazard Function.

## Software Used
* This project was done in R, the report was rendered into LaTeX using RMarkdown.
* I used the following R packages:
	- INLA to fit mixed effect model.
  - survival to comduct survival analysis.

## How to Use
* Read ```homework4c.pdf``` for assignment questions.
* Knit ```STA442 HW4.Rmd``` to generate the report.
* ```STA442-HW4.pdf``` is the generated report in PDF form.
