# STA2201 First Assignment

The first assignment consisted of two sections. In the first part I did the following:
- I conducted a simulation study to show that the Likelihood Ratio Statistic was asymptotically Chi Squared
- I derived the parameters of some distributions to yield some chosen moments. The ones which could not be analytically solved were solved using R. I then wrote a report about the effect on Male fruitfly lifespans of forced cohabitation with female Fruitflies.
- In the second part of the assignment I wrote a report about using the data from the 2014 Youth Tobacco Survey. Some of the main results that I found were:
	- White people were the most likely to chew tobacco followed by hispanics and black people
	- Older males living in rural areas had the largest odds of chewing tobacco regularly.
	- When it came to the odds of people using a Hookah at least once, the difference between men and women were not statistically  different.


## Skills Learned
I learned the following things:
* To conduct reproducible research using RMarkdown.
* How to use Gamma Regression.
* How to use a logistic regression model

## Software Used
* This project was done in R, the report was rendered into LaTeX using RMarkdown.
* I used the following R packages:
	- ggplot2 to generate visually appealing figures.
	- knitr to generate visually appealing tables.
	- nleqslv to solve for the parameters for the distributions with the prespecified moments.

## How to Use
* Knit A1Code.Rmd to generate the report.
* A folder  A1Code_files will also be generated. This will hold each of the figures from the report.
